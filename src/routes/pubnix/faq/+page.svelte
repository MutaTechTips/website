<span
	>A pubnix is a server running UNIX or a UNIX-like operating system that is
	opened to the public.</span

<h2>What can I do on the pubnix?</h2>
<span
	>Quite a lot! You can run containers, set up a website, and learn some
	amount of Linux system administration.</span
>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
<span
	>First, you need to <a href="/pubnix/register">register an account</a>.
	After registering, you need to wait a while because we manually check each
	registration. If you get accepted, you will receive an email.</span

<h2>10GB isn't enough for me!</h2>
<span
	>Money doesn't grow on trees :P. To make the project sustainable, we have
	decided to make extra storage (upto 30GB) on the Pubnix require at minimum
	an yearly donation of 10$ (or equivalent in UPI/Crypto). Once you have
	donated, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> so we can give you the extra
