## FAQ
#### What OS does the pubnix run?
It runs NixOS
#### Do you guys allow us to host websites from the pubnix?
Yes! Your website will be available as https://pb.projectsegfau.lt/(username).
#### Can I cryptomine?
No. It is strictly forbidden to mine cryptocurrencies on the pubnix. Doing this will get you immediately banned from using Project Segfault services, as you are utilizing a free service that we provide for your own monetary gain which is disgusting.
