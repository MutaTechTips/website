## How are these mods picked?

These are picked by our community or are required for server features like voice chatting.

## Can I use these plugins on Bedrock edition or the Forge mod loader?

These plugins only support Minecraft Java edition and most only work on the Fabric/Quilt modloaders. If you play on Bedrock or Forge mod loader, try to find an alternative to these. Mods like Simple Voice Chat have no alternative on Bedrock, sorry.
